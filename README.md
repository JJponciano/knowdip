# Knowledge-based object Detection in Image and Point cloud (KnowDIP)

[knowdip](http://i3mainz.hs-mainz.de/de/projekte/knowledge-based-object-detection-image-and-point-cloud-knowdip) is a project of the institute [i3mainz](http://i3mainz.hs-mainz.de)

## Instalation 
knowdip needs libraries to work including [JavaPointCloud](https://github.com/JJponciano/JavaPointCloud). Being entirely written in java, the easiest way to install it is to use MAVEN. To do so, install MAVEN by following the instructions given [here](https://maven.apache.org/install.html).

Then just clone or download the source code, go to the directory where the "pom.xml" file is located and execute the following command in a terminal: 

```
mvn install
```

The same process must **first** be performed on the [JavaPointCloud](https://github.com/JJponciano/JavaPointCloud) library on which knowdip depends.
